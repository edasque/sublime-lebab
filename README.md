# Sublime-Text 3 plugin for Lebab

*[lebab](https://github.com/mohebifar/lebab) transpiles your ES5 code to ES2015. It does exactly the opposite of what babel does*

This is a **Sublime Text plugin** for **lebab**

## Installation

Copy this directory into your Sublime Text 3 plugin directory. Figure out the rest yourself, for now

## TODO
* Make sure lebab can be found, always
* As such, rely on its node_modules being installed instead of bundling the whole lot
* Bundle this as an actual plugin
* Make options effective

## Credit

A lot of this code was borrowed from [Babel-Sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime), copyright Andres Suarez, MIT license.
